				Be-SCF/MBPT[2]/CISD

The data necessary to do the "standard" Be SCF problem which
Dr. Bartlett likes to assign his students are in /scr_1/qtp/rjb/ap/6480
directory. 

Integrals:
There are 6 AO basis functions (2 1s, 4 2s).  The necessary integrals
are already computed, and live in file BERSHG.DAT.  The two electron
integrals use the Dirac convention ( i.e. <12|12> ), not the Mulliken
convention (i.e. (11|22) ).  For the more conventional theorist, the
file MULBERSHG.DAT contains the same information as BERSHG.DAT, but
with the two-electron integrals in Mulliken notation.

The integrals require the following dimensions:
C      Dimension overlap, one- and two-electron integral matrices
       DOUBLE PRECISION S(6,6), H(6,6), G2(6,6,6,6)

And they can be read in using the following fragment:
C     Read in all integrals from unit 1
      OPEN (4, FILE='BERSHG.DAT', FORM='FORMATTED')
      REWIND 4
      READ (4,*) S, H, G2
      CLOSE (4)

Answer:
E(RHF) = -14.573020 Hartree for the 1s^2 2s^2 state.
